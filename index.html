    <!-- About Section -->
    <section class="about">
        <p>
            Tuning Neural is focused on advancing intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and operate reliably in real-world industrial environments. Our early work explores AI that understands complex machinery, anticipates issues before they happen, and supports operators with clear, data-driven insights. We believe the next generation of AI must be not only powerful — but trustworthy, transparent, and aligned with human decision-making.

    <section class="building">
        <h2>What We're Building</h2>
        <p>
            We are developing intelligent monitoring systems that interpret sensor data in real time, AI-powered decision support tools for industrial operations, early-warning analytics to help teams act before failures occur, and the foundations for predictive technologies that empower safer engineering. Our focus is on systems that turn complexity into clarity and help organizations reduce downtime while improving safety and reliability.

    <!-- Why It Matters Section -->
    <section class="why-matters">
        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Reliable AI helps industries reduce downtime, improve safety, and make more informed decisions. Our goal is to make advanced intelligence accessible and dependable for the physical world — not just the digital one. When machines are understood deeply and monitored intelligently, entire industries become safer, more efficient, and more resilient.

    <!-- Vision Section -->
    <section class="vision">
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            We imagine a future where AI collaborates with humans, understands context, and continuously improves. Tuning Neural is taking steps toward this future by building systems grounded in clarity, trust, and real-world impact. Advanced intelligence that blends learning, reasoning, and real-world understanding — accessible, dependable, and designed for engineers, operators, and decision-makers.
